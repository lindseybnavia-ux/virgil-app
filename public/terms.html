The Service includes session logging, AI-generated action items, progress tracking, growth insights, and optional Google Calendar integration.</p>

    <h2>3. Account Registration</h2>
    <p>To use the Service, you must create an account with a valid email address. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to provide accurate and complete information and to update it as needed.</p>

    <h2>4. Subscription and Payment</h2>
    <p>Virgil offers paid subscription plans with a 7-day free trial. By subscribing, you agree to the following: Payment is processed securely through Stripe. Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period (monthly or annual) unless cancelled. You may cancel your subscription at any time. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. Refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis. Please contact us at support@tryvirgil.co for refund requests.</p>

    <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful purpose, attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its systems, interfere with or disrupt the Service, share your account credentials with others, or use the Service to store or transmit malicious content.</p>

    <h2>6. AI-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>The Service uses artificial intelligence (Anthropic's Claude) to generate action items and growth insights based on your session notes. You acknowledge and agree that AI-generated content is provided as suggestions and should not be considered professional medical, psychological, or therapeutic advice. Virgil is not a substitute for professional therapy, counseling, or medical treatment. You are responsible for evaluating and deciding whether to act on any AI-generated suggestions. AI outputs may occasionally be inaccurate or not fully relevant to your situation.</p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Integrations</h2>
    <p>The Service offers optional integration with Google Calendar. By connecting your Google Calendar, you authorize Virgil to create, update, and delete calendar events on your behalf. You may disconnect this integration at any time. Your use of Google Calendar is also subject to Google's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Content</h2>
    <p>You retain ownership of all content you submit to the Service, including session notes, uploaded photos, and voice recordings. By using the Service, you grant us a limited license to process your content as necessary to provide the Service (including sending session notes to AI for action item generation). We do not claim ownership of your content and will not use it for purposes unrelated to providing the Service.</p>

    <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Virgil and its operators shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Service. Our total liability for any claim related to the Service shall not exceed the amount you paid for the Service in the 12 months preceding the claim.</p>

    <h2>12. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the Service will be error-free or that AI-generated content will be accurate or suitable for your needs.</p>
